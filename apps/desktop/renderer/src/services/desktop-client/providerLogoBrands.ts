/**
 * Brand registry for the models.dev provider icons used across the renderer.
 *
 * models.dev serves one icon per brand, so every Pi builtin entry that fronts
 * the same product family has to resolve to that brand's icon id. The icon id
 * cannot be derived from the Provider ID or the display name and cannot be
 * confirmed by requesting the URL: an unknown id still answers HTTP 200 with a
 * generic placeholder sprite. Brand membership is therefore declared here once
 * and every surface keeps consuming the `logoURL` the catalogue already emits.
 *
 * Each group lists its full Provider ID set explicitly. Provider IDs that appear
 * in no group resolve to their own id, so user created providers and builtin
 * entries that models.dev already keys by Provider ID keep working. `google-vertex`
 * and `opencode-go` stay out of their parent brand group on purpose: models.dev
 * ships a distinct icon for each of them.
